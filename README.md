# Crazy Cards Application

## Description
- The user should submit their details via a form.
- The application should then return a filtered list of cards available to that user; use the rules outlined at the end of this document to decide whether a particular card is available.
- The user should be allowed to select one or more of the returned cards and see the details for the cards selected.
- When multiple cards are selected, the total amount of credit available to the user on those cards should be displayed.

## What is expected

Beyond meeting the spec outlined above, we would like to see a solution which demonstrates the following:

- Familiarity with React and the use of components
- Extensible logic (e.g. resilient to addition of cards and/or card availability rules)
- Good application architecture
- A sensible approach to testing

Brownie points for:

- Responsive web design
- Mock endpoints
- Hand-rolled server configuration
